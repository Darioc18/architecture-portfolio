## Brief

The goal of this project is to create a portfolio-style website showcasing the projects I have worked on as an architect. My main aim is to demonstrate my competence in HTML and CSS by developing a visually appealing and user-friendly static front-end application.

It is important to note that this portfolio is not intended for professional use; rather, it serves as a showcase to highlight my skills and competence with CSS and HTML.

## Goal

The primary goal of creating this website is to showcase my architecture portfolio, featuring the projects I have worked on. By presenting my professional accomplishments and showcasing my design skills, I aim to:

- Provide potential clients, employers, and collaborators with a comprehensive overview of my architectural expertise;
- Include information about me, allowing visitors to gain insights into my background, qualifications, and design philosophy;
- Include a contact section to enable interested parties to reach out to me directly, providing a platform for communication and potential opportunities.

Overall, this website would serve as a dynamic platform to exhibit personal architectural achievements, establish a professional online presence, and foster connections within the industry.

## User Experience (UX)

### As a Target User, I want:

- To easily find information about the architect's experience, qualifications, and relevant certifications to assess their expertise and credibility;
- The website to showcase a diverse range of project types (residential, commercial, etc.) to gauge the architect's versatility and adaptability;
- To highlight any collaborative efforts or notable partnerships the architect has engaged in, demonstrating their ability to work effectively with a team;
- The website to provide a gallery or portfolio section showcasing high-quality images that highlight the architect's attention to detail and craftsmanship;
- The website to offer a way to easily request additional information or schedule a meeting with the architect to discuss specific project needs.

### As a First-Time User, I want:

- To easily navigate the website to understand its purpose and content quickly;
- To be able to view the site on wide range of devices.
- To explore the projects in the architecture portfolio and view detailed information about each project;
- To learn more about the architect by accessing their profile or bio section;
- To have a clear understanding of how to contact the architect through the website's contact section;
- The website to provide a visually appealing and intuitive interface that encourages further exploration.

### As a Returning User, I want:

- The website to provide regular updates on new projects or achievements by the architect;
- To have a seamless experience when contacting the architect through the website, ensuring my message reaches them successfully

## Design

In designing this website, my intention was to keep the colors and layout minimalistic. This approach allows the projects showcased in the portfolio to take center stage, each having its unique style and color palette. By adopting a simple design, the goal is to create a visual environment where the projects can truly stand out and captivate the viewer's attention.

### Wireframes

Displayed below are a set of wireframes illustrating the various pages of the portfolio. The elements in red indicate some specific features that I intend to incorporate in a future revision.

### Colours

In line with the principle mentioned above, I aimed to adhere to a minimalistic color palette, consisting of black, white, and two distinct shades of grey. This deliberate choice allows for a clean and understated aesthetic, ensuring that the focus remains on the projects themselves while maintaining a cohesive and visually appealing design. I created a visual palette by using [coolors.co](https://coolors.co).

## Brief
The goal of this project is to create a portfolio-style website showcasing the projects I have worked on as an architect. My main aim is to demonstrate my competence in HTML and CSS by developing a visually appealing and user-friendly static front-end application.

It is important to note that this portfolio is not intended for professional use; rather, it serves as a showcase to highlight my skills and competence with CSS and HTML.
## Goal

The primary goal of creating this website is to showcase my architecture portfolio, featuring the projects I have worked on. By presenting my professional accomplishments and showcasing my design skills, I aim to:

- Provide potential clients, employers, and collaborators with a comprehensive overview of my architectural expertise;
- Include information about me, allowing visitors to gain insights into my background, qualifications, and design philosophy;
- Provide a contact section to enable interested parties to reach out to me directly, providing a platform for communication and potential opportunities.

Overall, this website would serve as a dynamic platform to exhibit personal architectural achievements, establish a professional online presence, and foster connections within the industry.

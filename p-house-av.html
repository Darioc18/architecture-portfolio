          <h2>HOUSE AV</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            The apartment is situated in a historical five-story building from
            the early 20th century. The occupant of the flat is currently a
            single individual who is focused on their career. Due to their busy
            lifestyle, the client required a small study area for work and a
            place to unwind.
          </p>
          <p>
            The apartment boasts three large east-facing windows that offer a
            scenic view of the Adriatic Sea. To make the most of the abundant
            natural light flowing in through the windows, a deliberate choice
            was made. The concept involved using evanescent diaphragms, which
            are drape-like walls made of oak wood and translucent glass, to
            divide the different areas of the living space. These areas
            encompass cooking and dining, leisure time, recreational activities,
            and work.
